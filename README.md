# Integration

Checks out and builds the ITP plasma suite of codes for integration tests. Can be
triggered with `$BRANCH_NAME` variable to checkout a specific branch and fall back
to `main` if a code doesn't have it. Main use is to test changes in `libneo` and
how they affect the rest of the codes.
