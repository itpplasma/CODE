GPEC User Agreement
===================

GPEC development is funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) through the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), and distribution is subject to DoE and PPPL requirements and restrictions.

The scientific results from the use of GPEC are intended for publication and sharing in the open scientific community.

In order to acquire access to the code sources and/or executables, the user must agree to the following:

1. The user will not rename, modify or redistribute the code, in whole or in part, to 3rd parties without consent of the authors, although the code may be imbedded unmodified and shared within a larger software project.

2. If modifications or improvements are needed, these will be developed in collaboration with the authors, so that they may be redistributed through the GPEC git versioning distributions to the benefit of all GPEC users.

3. The users will include the proper code name(s) and appropriate references in published results and presentations. The user will email a draft of any article/report/presentation/etc. using GPEC results to the authors prior to publishing.
